  The code here started as a fork from MRC Mystic Client (1.2.9a) by 
  Stackfault, which is itself a fork of Gryphon's MRC client. As of this 
  version, it is quickly being rewritten from the ground up with 100% original 
  code.
  
  This product is provided as is, with no warranty of any kind. If it breaks, 
  you have the pieces. But it shouldn't break. Ever.
