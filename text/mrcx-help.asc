|12PRIVACY NOTICE|07

  MRC as a protocol is currently unencrypted. This means your SysOp can read 
  your private messages, as they are sent cleartext to other BBSes. Therefore, 
  you should use caution when using private message chats with other users on 
  MRC. Assume they're being read by other users, because they certainly are.
  
  mrcX is currently experimenting with some encryption schemes to be used to
  help with privacy using MRC. You can use the /tx <nick> <msg> command to
  transmit a secure message which can be read /?

|15GENERAL INFORMATION|07

  mrcX is a chat client used to chat on Multi Relay Chat (MRC). mrcX is also
  without any proper pronunciation. In fact, you can't say it, as it has no
  vowels. But that is okay, it is meant to be used, not spoken. <waves hands
  around in a needlessly confusing Jedi-like manner>

|15HISTORY|07

  The code here started as a fork from MRC Mystic Client (1.2.9a) by 
  Stackfault, which is itself a fork of Gryphon's MRC client. As of this 
  version, it is quickly being rewritten from the ground up with 100% original 
  code.
  
|15TRIBUTE|07

  Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The
  round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently.
  They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You
  can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only
  thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push 
  the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we
  see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change
  the world, are the ones who do. -Steve Jobs
